      This build has not finished receiving data from your CI service or client. If this has been pending for a while, your client may have failed to upload or finalize all snapshots. This build can be safely ignored, it will not be used as a baseline for visual diffs.
    </p>
  {{else if build.isFailed}}
    {{#if (eq build.failureReason 'missing_resources')}}
      <p>Your CI service or client failed to correctly upload build and snapshot resources.</p>
      <p>This build can be safely ignored, it will not be used as a baseline for visual diffs. If these failures happen frequently, check your CI or client logs for failures.</p>
    {{/if}}
    {{#if (eq build.failureReason 'no_snapshots')}}
      <p>No snapshots were uploaded to this build, so there was nothing to compare.</p>
      <p>This could happen if your tests failed in your CI environment and nothing was uploaded to Percy. This build can be safely ignored, it will not be used as a baseline for visual diffs. If these failures happen frequently, check your CI or client logs for failures.</p>
    {{/if}}
    {{#if (eq build.failureReason 'render_timeout')}}
      <p>Some snapshots in this build took too long to render even after multiple retries.</p>
      <p>This can happen in rare cases when a page loads an asset that takes too long and hangs the Percy renderer. We have automatically recorded this error and will look into it, but feel free to <a href="#" {{action showSupport}} data-test-build-overview-show-support>reach out</a> and we can help get this fixed.</p>
